      title: "What is a Linear Function?",
      explanation: "A linear function is a function whose graph is a straight line. It has the form f(x)=mx+b, where m is the slope, b is the y-intercept, and x is the independent variable.",
      question: "What is the general form of a linear function?",
      answer: "f(x)=mx+b"

      title: "Identifying Linear Functions",
      explanation: "A function is linear if it has a constant rate of change, no variable exponents or multiplications between variables, and the graph is a straight line.",
      question: "Is y = x^2 + 1 a linear function?",
      answer: "no"

      title: "Slope-Intercept Form",
      explanation: "The slope-intercept form is y = mx + b. Use this when you know the slope and the y-intercept.",

      answer: "y-intercept"

      title: "Intercepts",
      explanation: "Y-intercept is where x=0. X-intercept is where y=0.",
