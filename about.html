      <h2>ðŸŒŸ The Mission</h2>
      <p>To make learning efficient, focused, and accessible for high school students â€” one subject at a time.</p>

      <h2>ðŸ’¡ Why I Built This</h2>
      <p>I created yourTutor because there was a large amount of my peers that were asking me for my practice tests that I was making. So I decided that it would be smart to not only develop a method to make my practice tests accessible to everyone, but I could also implement other study methods into a website that could help students even more. So I mixed my growing passion for stem and specifically coding in this case with my passion of helping people.</p>
